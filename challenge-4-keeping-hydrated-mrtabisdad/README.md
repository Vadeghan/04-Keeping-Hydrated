# Challenge #4 - Keeping Hydrated

## Overview
> Create a function that calculates the amount of water you need depending on the number of hours you have cycled, supposing that you drink 0.5 litres per hour

#### Input:
A number (either an integer or float), representing the numbers of hours you've been cycling

#### Output:
Another number, representing the number of litres of water you need

#### Examples:
```
needed_water(3) => 1
needed_water(6.7) => 3
needed_water(11.8) => 5
needed_water(84.49) => 42
```

## Extension
No extension. To get bonus points, try to use the most creative method you can think of.
